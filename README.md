## A guitar version of *Haruhikage* from anime *BanG Dream! It's Mygo!!!!!*.

The sound of guitar is implemented by proj1a from UC Berkeley's CS61B. To play the sound, CS61B libraries are required, which can be accessed on [https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/library-fa24](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/library-fa24).

GuitarString.java and GuitarPlayer.java implement the sound of a single tone. Haruhikage.java implements the musical score of *Haruhikage*.

By running the main method in Haruhikage.java, you can hear a guitar version of *Haruhikage*.
